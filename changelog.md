## v1.9
- Roster persistence hardening: versioned storage schema `{schema, savedAt, source, owned}`,
  single `loadRoster()` / `saveRoster()` path, one-time migration from pre-v1.9 bare array
- Defensive roster re-read on every entry to the Roster screen
- "Last saved" indicator on Roster screen (date, time, source)
- Export roster to clipboard (with select-to-copy fallback)
- Import roster: paste JSON, validate before mutating, replace semantics,
  lenient-reported (imported / skipped counts), Undo import for session rollback
- `applyRoster(owned, source)` shared entry point — v2.0 API import reuses this
- Best-effort `navigator.storage.persist()` request to reduce OS eviction
- Collapsible "Manage roster data" panel (Export / Import / Undo / Clear roster)
- Clear Roster moved from header into panel — destructive action, rare in SWGOH
- Roster loss reproduced under Safari Private Browsing (expected ephemeral-storage behaviour);
  normal browsing retains storage; persist() remains as best-effort eviction resistance for
  the non-private cases.
  (Note: this supersedes an earlier provisional v1.9 attribution to iOS WebKit app-switcher
  eviction, which was a misdiagnosis. The reproducible cause is Safari Private Browsing's
  ephemeral storage, which persist() cannot prevent by design.)
## v2.0
- Roster import from SWGOH.gg: enter a 9-digit ally code to populate ownership directly
  from your account. Manual toggling and paste-JSON import remain as fallbacks.
- Apps Script extended with an `action` router: default `action=data` returns the unchanged
  counter payload; `action=roster&allyCode=…` is a thin server-side proxy to the swgoh.gg
  player endpoint, returning `{ ok, allyCode, syncedAt, ownedBaseIds }` (base_ids only).
- `External_ID` adapter column added to `Character_Definitions`; `characterDefinitions` now
  carries `externalId`. The client builds a base_id → Character_ID reverse index and maps
  imported units locally, keeping `Character_ID` as the stable internal key (the sheet
  remains the single source of truth for the mapping).
- Roster schema bumped to v2 `{schema, savedAt, source, allyCode, syncedAt, owned}` with a
  v1 → v2 migration. `syncedAt` (last successful API return) is tracked separately from
  `savedAt` (last local write of any kind).
- Cache-first architecture: localStorage is the working store and the API is a refresh
  mechanism, not a dependency. The app renders from cache instantly on boot and is fully
  functional on cached data alone.
- Staleness-gated background sync: an API roster refreshes silently on boot only if `syncedAt`
  is older than 12 hours, never while the Roster screen is open (never mid-edit), and applies
  only if the owned set actually changed (with an Undo snapshot when it does).
- Source-aware freshness line: API rosters show "Last synced from SWGOH.gg: …", manual
  rosters show "Last saved: …".
- First-run import card promoted on the Roster screen when the roster is empty; becomes a
  "Refresh from SWGOH.gg" control once an ally code is associated.
- Import reporting split into three buckets: characters imported, ships recognised but not yet
  supported (silent — fleet is v2.5), and units not yet in the app's database.
- Import pipeline written unit-type-parameterised, defaulting to characters only, so fleet
  support (v2.5) is a flag-flip plus roster/UI work rather than a re-architecture.
- Foreground import/refresh: ally-code validation, offline guard, timeout guard
  (`ROSTER_FETCH_TIMEOUT_MS`), per-case error copy (invalid code, not-found-on-swgoh.gg,
  rate-limited, timeout, offline), confirm-before-overwrite, and Undo.
- Import message + Undo moved to a top-level notice cluster on the Roster screen so results
  are visible even when the data panel is collapsed.
- Bump service-worker cache name to force fresh assets for installed users.
- Roster data source subsequently switched from swgoh.gg to a self-hosted SWGOH Comlink
  instance (Render free tier), after swgoh.gg began returning HTTP 403 to Apps Script egress
  IPs — a hard block, not a quota issue. The response contract (`{ ok, allyCode, syncedAt,
  ownedBaseIds }`) is unchanged; `rosterUnit[].definitionId` uses `BASEID:RARITY` format,
  split on the colon to recover base_ids. Import timeout extended to 60 seconds to
  accommodate Render's cold-start latency on the first request after inactivity.
- User-facing language made source-neutral following the migration (e.g. the roster-overwrite
  confirmation no longer names swgoh.gg); internal sentinel values deliberately preserved
  unchanged to avoid breaking auto-sync eligibility on existing rosters. One instance of the
  old wording was found and corrected in v2.1 (see below).

## v2.1 — Round Planning
- Bottom-nav "Banners" replaced by a single **Round screen**: round summary, opponent board,
  allocation recommendations, and banner tracking together as the live-match workspace.
  Reset Round moves here from Counters and now clears the board alongside used teams and
  banner tracking. A wayfinding line on the Counters screen points players to Round for
  round tracking and reset.
- **Opponent board:** four territories per league/mode, generated from the new
  `GAC_Board_Config` sheet tab. League is a persisted user setting; mode is frozen into
  the board at setup from the Counters screen toggle. Per-team `cleared` flag with a bulk
  "Clear territory" shortcut; territory-cleared state is always derived from per-team flags,
  never stored separately. Back Bottom locked until Front Bottom is cleared; Back Top
  permanently locked with a "fleet support arrives in v2.5" note. Teams not in the counter
  catalogue can be marked "Not in catalogue" and still tracked for cleared state. Board is
  versioned (schema 1) and hydrates before first paint, same pattern as the roster.
- **Allocation engine:** scarcity-first ordered search with branch-and-bound pruning and a
  50,000-node budget (result is never worse than pure greedy, since the greedy path is
  explored first). Objective is coverage → tier → banner score, in that order (Option A).
  Character-level exclusivity enforced natively — two counters that share a required
  character can never appear in the same plan, since characters used on offence are spent
  for the round regardless of battle outcome. Runs against the visible-uncleared board
  team set only; fleet territory excluded. Live-solved on every Round-screen render;
  nothing about the plan is persisted.
- **Overlap notice:** when two or more visible-uncleared teams share at least one
  eligible-and-owned-and-unused counter, an explicit banner announces the switch to
  optimised, cross-team-aware recommendations.
- **Per-team recommendation cards:** chosen counter, colour-coded tier badge, expected
  banners, a plain-language reason grounded in the plan's real alternatives (e.g. "Also
  counters Great Mothers — SLKR covers that one instead"), and a "Mark used" button that
  commits the counter and triggers an immediate re-solve. Four distinct empty-state reasons
  cover no catalogue match, none owned, all used, and committed elsewhere via a named
  character clash.
- **Sheet:** new `GAC_Board_Config` tab (team counts per territory, for every league × mode
  combination) and new `GAC_Scoring` tab (the full GAC banner economy — victory, attempt,
  survival, health, protection, unused-slot, and territory-clear bonuses). Both sourced
  from the SWGOH Wiki; scoring values are earmarked for a spot-check against real battle
  results before the points-to-win calculator is built on top of them.
- **Backend:** Apps Script `action=data` payload extended with `boardConfig` and `scoring`
  keys, read by header name with positional fallbacks and guarded against missing or empty
  tabs (empty object/array rather than an error). Fully backwards-compatible — the v2.0
  frontend ignores unknown keys.
- **Service worker:** cache name bumped (`swgoh-cache-v3`, then `swgoh-cache-v4`) to force
  fresh assets for installed users across the two build stages; `styles.css` added to the
  precache list, closing a pre-existing gap where a fully offline launch would have
  rendered unstyled.
- **Copy fix:** the roster-overwrite confirmation dialog no longer names swgoh.gg by name,
  completing the source-neutral language pass that began with the Comlink migration.
